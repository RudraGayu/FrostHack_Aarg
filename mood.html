    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id="dem1">Your mood and your mental health affect every aspect of your life, from how you feel about yourself to
        your relationships with others and your physical health. There's a strong link between <br>good mental health
        and good physical health, and vice versa.</p>
    <h2>Mood And health</h2>
    <p id="dem1">Poorly-managed negative emotions are not good for your health. Negative attitudes and feelings of
        helplessness and hopelessness can create chronic stress, which upsets the body's hormone<br> balance, depletes
        the brain chemicals required for happiness, and damages the immune system.</p>
    <details>
        <p id="dem3">It’s clear to most of us, and to science, that our moods can affect how we feel, physically. When
            we’re happy, we tend to feel lighter, brighter and more energetic – think of the feeling of being in love.
        </p>
        <p id="dem1">Conversely, when we are down after a setback, such as a breakup, we feel unmotivated, tired and,
            sometimes, physically unwell. We can also turn to unhealthy behaviours, <br>such as drinking too much and
            junk food binges.</p>

    <p id="dem3"><b><i>Incorporate laughter:</b></i></p>
    <p id="dem6"> The phrase, "Laughter is the best medicine," has become a cliché because it’s so true. We know that
        laughter has benefits far beyond mood. Laughter can actually enhance immunity and prolong life.</p>
    <p id="dem3"><b><i>Change your perspective:</b></i></p>
    <p id="dem6"> One quick and simple way to turn your mood around is to change your expectations and comparison.
        Instead of looking at what you don’t have, look at all that you do have. Revel in the benefits of gratitude,4
        and change the way you view what you have (and don’t have), and you can feel more happiness right away.</p>

            • When you do something nice for someone else, your focus turns away from yourself and your own problems,
            and toward others and helping them feel good.<br>
            • A smile that you bring to someone else’s face is a contagious smile, bringing contagious happiness.<br>
            • A quick, happiness-toting good deed can be anything from a kind word to a stressed store clerk to a large
            gift for a loved one or a charity, and can make you feel happy right away—happiness that’s shared.
