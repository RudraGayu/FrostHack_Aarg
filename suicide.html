    <h2>Treatment for people who are at risk for suicide</h2>
    <h3>Talk therapy</h3>
    <details>
        Its purpose is to teach you how to work through stressful life events and emotions that may be contributing to
        your suicidal thoughts and behavior. CBT can also help you replace negative beliefs with positive ones and
        <br>regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life.
    </details>
    <h3>Medication</h3>
    <details>
        If talk therapy isn’t enough to successfully lower risk, medication may be prescribed to ease symptoms, such as
        depression and anxiety. Treating these symptoms can help reduce or eliminate suicidal thoughts.<br>
        <p>One or more of the following types of medication could be prescribed:</p>
        • antidepressants<br>
        • antipsychotic medications<br>
        • anti-anxiety medications<br>
    </details>
    <h3>Lifestyle changes</h3>
    <details>
        1. Avoiding alcohol and drugs: Staying away from alcohol and drugs is critical, as these substances can lower
        inhibitions and may increase the risk for suicide.<br>
