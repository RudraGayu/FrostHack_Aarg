        <h3>PSYCHOTIC DISORDER</h3>
        <p>They're a group of mental health conditions that change your sense of reality. They make it hard to know
            what's real and what isn't. When you have these disorders, you might see and hear things that don't exist or
            believe things that aren't true.

        <h3>SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDER</h3>
        <p>
            The main ones are hallucinations, delusions, and disordered forms of thinking.
            <strong>Hallucinations</strong> means seeing, hearing, or feeling things that don’t exist. For instance,
            someone might see things that aren't there, hear voices, smell odors, have a "funny" taste in their mouth,
            or feel sensations on their skin even though nothing is touching their body.
            <br>
            <strong>Delusions</strong> are false beliefs that don’t go away even after they've been shown to be false.
            For example, a person who is certain their food is poisoned, even if someone has shown them that the food is
            fine, has a delusion.

        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
        <p>Most psychotic disorders are treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy, which is a type of
            counseling
            <br>
            <strong>Medication:</strong>The main type of drug that doctors prescribe to treat psychotic disorders are
            “antipsychotics.” Although these medicines aren’t a cure, they are effective in managing the most troubling
            symptoms of psychotic disorders, such as delusions, hallucinations, and thinking problems.
            <br>
            <strong>Psychotherapy: </strong>Most people with psychotic disorders are treated as outpatients, meaning
            they don’t live in institutions. But sometimes people need to be hospitalized, such as if they have severe
            symptoms, are in danger of hurting themselves or others, or can’t care for themselves because of their
            illness.
