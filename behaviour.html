        <h3>BEHAVIORAL DISORDER</h3>
        <p>Behavioral disorders, also known as disruptive behavioral disorders, are the most common reasons that parents
            are told to take their kids for mental health assessments and treatment. Behavioral disorders are also
            common in adults. If left untreated in childhood, these disorders can negatively affect a person’s ability
            to hold a job and maintain relationships.</p>

        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
        <p>Parent management training has been shown to work very well for children and teens with behavioural
            disorders. It is most effective when started early in childhood or the pre-teen years, but it is never too
            late to change the way you handle your child or teen's behaviour. In many cases, you can access parent
            management training through a children's mental health agency, a parenting group or a private therapist.<br>
            <br>
            Individual therapy or family therapy can also be effective in helping to manage behavioural disorders.
            Therapy can help change how a family functions and support parents and children or teens with figuring out
            the causes of challenging behaviour and talking about other ways of handling them.
