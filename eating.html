        <h3>EATING DISORDER</h3>
        <p>An eating disorder is a mental disorder defined by abnormal eating habits that negatively affect a person's
            physical and/or mental health.
            <br>
            Eating disorders are mental health conditions marked by an obsession with food or body shape. They can
            affect anyone but are most prevalent among young women.

        <h3>SYMPTOMS OF EATING DISORDER</h3>
        <p>
            Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating
            disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and
            avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

        <h3>CAUSES OF EATING DISORDER</h3>
        <p>
            Genetics and biology. Certain people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders.
            Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating disorders.
            <br>
            Psychological and emotional health. People with eating disorders may have psychological and emotional
            problems that contribute to the disorder. They may have low self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior
            and troubled relationships

        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
        <p>Significant progress has been achieved in the development and evaluation of evidence-based psychological
            treatments for eating disorders over the past 25 years. Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the
            treatment of choice for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, and existing evidence supports the use of
            a specific form of family therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Important challenges remain. Even
            the most effective interventions for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder fail to help a substantial
            number of patients. A priority must be the extension and adaptation of these treatments to a broader range
            of eating disorders (eating disorder not otherwise specified), to adolescents, who have been largely
            overlooked in clinical research, and to chronic, treatment-resistant cases of anorexia nervosa</p>
